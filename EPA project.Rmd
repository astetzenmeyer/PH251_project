## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

library(readxl)
Count_of_total_pesticide_illness_by_activity <- read_excel("~/PHW251_Fall2021/Count of total pesticide illness by activity.xlsx")


```

```{r}

colnames(Count_of_total_pesticide_illness_by_activity)

```

```{r}

pesticide_illness<- Count_of_total_pesticide_illness_by_activity %>%
   rename( activity = "Count of Acute Pesticide-Related Illnesses by Activity, All Participating States, 1998 - 2011") %>%
  rename(count =  "...2" ) %>%
  select(!"...3") %>%
 mutate(`count` = as.factor(`count`))
 

 new_pesticide_illness <- na.omit(pesticide_illness)
 
 new_pesticide_illness = new_pesticide_illness[-c(1),]
 
 new_pesticide_illness <- new_pesticide_illness %>%
   group_by(count) %>%
   arrange(desc(count))
 
 str(new_pesticide_illness)

```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}


ggplot(new_pesticide_illness , aes(x = count, y = activity)) +
 geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  labs(fill = "Group",
       title = "Pesticide Illness")



```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
